## Solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Solutions for some problems in Aoc.

This is mostly a learning experience with Rust, so the solutions are probably messy, but they work.

### Implemented

- Year 2019 (full)
- Year 2020 (in progress)

### Usage

The executable expects three arguments:

* `--year` The year (full or only two last digits)
* `--day` The day between 01 and 25
* The path to the file containing the input for the day

It will print the name of the problem, its solution and also the time it took to solve.
